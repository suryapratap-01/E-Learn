# Admin Console Data Loading Issue - Solution

## Problem
The user data in the admin console doesn't load simultaneously and requires multiple clicks/taps to load.

## Root Cause
The main issue is that **the JSON server backend is not running**. The Angular application is trying to make API calls to `http://localhost:3000/users`, but there's no server running on that port.

## Solution

### 1. Install Required Dependencies
First, install the missing dependencies for running the JSON server:

```bash
npm install --save-dev json-server concurrently
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
You have two options:

#### Option A: Start JSON Server Manually
```bash
npx json-server --watch json_db/db.json --routes json_db/routes.json --port 3000
```

#### Option B: Use the New Scripts (Recommended)
I've added new scripts to your `package.json`:

```bash
# Start only the API server
npm run api

# Start both API server and Angular dev server simultaneously
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify the Fix
1. Start the JSON server using one of the methods above
2. Navigate to the admin console in your Angular app
3. The user data should now load immediately without requiring multiple clicks

## Technical Details

### What Was Happening Before:
- Angular app tries to call `GET http://localhost:3000/users`
- No server running on port 3000
- HTTP request fails silently or times out
- Component remains in loading state
- User has to click/tap multiple times hoping it will work

### What Happens Now:
- JSON server runs on port 3000 serving the data from `json_db/db.json`
- Angular app successfully fetches user data
- Component loads data immediately on initialization

## Additional Improvements Made

I also made some improvements to the admin console component for better error handling:

1. **Proper Lifecycle Management**: Added `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` interfaces
2. **Error Handling**: Added error states and retry mechanisms
3. **Subscription Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. **User Feedback**: Error messages with retry buttons

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added scripts and dependencies
- `src/app/features/admin/admin-console.component.ts` - Improved error handling
- `src/app/features/admin/admin-console.component.html` - Added error display
- `src/app/features/admin/admin-console.component.scss` - Added error styling
- `src/app/features/admin/admin.service.ts` - Added timeout and retry logic

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm install` to install the new dependencies
2. Use `npm run dev` to start both servers
3. Test the admin console - it should work immediately now!
